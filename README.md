On April, 21, 2020, Dr. Iain McGilchrist, author of The Master and His Emissary and The Matter With Things, recorded himself reading a poem and posted it on his youtube channel. He continued to read a poem a day for an entire year. This project has collected all of his readings and synced them up with the poems themselves to make it easy to listen and follow along at the same time.
